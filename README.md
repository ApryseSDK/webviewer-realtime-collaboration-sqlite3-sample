# WebViewer Real Time Collaboration Sample - using WebSocket, SQLite3 and Node.js server

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://www.pdftron.com). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate, and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This is a WebViewer sample to show how you can construct a real time collaboration server for WebViewer through `WebSocket`, `SQLite3`, and `Node.js` server.

The below diagram depicts the structure of the real time collaboration sample app.

## Initial setup

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/PDFTron/webviewer-realtime-collaboration-sqlite3-sample.git
cd webviewer-realtime-collaboration-sqlite3-sample
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

### Port

 In case your Windows development machine has restrictions on accessing port 8181, an error will return `code: 'EACCES'` and `port: 8181`. To solve this error, the easiest solution is to change to one accessible port. In Windows find the ports that are restricted with `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp`. To change the port, find the two locations in the files below and update to the new port:

```
//\server\annotationHandler.js

`const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8181});`

//\client\index.js

const url = `ws://${hostName}:8181`;
```


## How to use

- Run a WebViewer instance with the `npm start` command. An instance of the WebViewer will run on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/index.html) using your default browser.
- Open up two other browsers, one in incognito mode and another separate instance using a different major browser, all listening to [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/index.html). 
- Create annotations with the annotations tools on one of the browsers, and observe the annotations appear on the other two browsers in real time.
- You can also access the real time server from a different device in the same network via replacing `localhost` in your URL to the server's IP address.
